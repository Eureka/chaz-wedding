            <p>
            Fiona and Chas are photography lovers and are eager to share memories of their honeymoon and perhaps more of the family as it grows!
 To that end they are really looking for a professional camera to capture those memories.
 This is the kind of gift that is far beyond what they would expect to get but are hoping that you might contribute!
 Join the wedding crowdgifting revolution!
 They are hoping to have a budget of X with which to purchase a camera and Tripod <u>BEFORE THE WEDDING</u>.

Chas’ Dad is graciously covering much of the cost of the Honeymoon but there are several extras that we would love to do while on the ship!
 These excursions range from $200-$500 per person and range from helicopter tours to guided glacier treks. Examples Below!
