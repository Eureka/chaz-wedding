We've reserved blocks of rooms at hotels in Sheridan, WY for guests attending our wedding. If you're planning to attend and have not reserved a hotel room, we recommend you do soon.

All the info you'll need to reserve a hotel room is on our website:

When booking a reservation it's best to call the hotel and mention it's for the "Galey/Seifert" wedding.
